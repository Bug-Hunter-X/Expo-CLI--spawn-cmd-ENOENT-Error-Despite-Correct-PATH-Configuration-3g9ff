The solution to this problem may depend on the root cause, which is not always immediately clear from the error message.  There is no single universal fix for `spawn cmd ENOENT`.  The following steps outline a diagnostic and troubleshooting process:

1. **Verify Node.js and npm/yarn installations:** Make absolutely sure that Node.js and your package manager are installed correctly and accessible from your command line.  Try running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`).
2. **Check PATH environment variable:**  Double-check that the PATH variable includes the directory containing cmd.exe (or your shell's equivalent).  The exact path will depend on your operating system.
3. **System Restart:** A simple restart can often resolve inconsistencies in the environment variables.
4. **Reinstall Expo CLI:**  Completely remove and reinstall the Expo CLI: `npm uninstall -g expo-cli && npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global remove expo-cli && yarn global add expo-cli`. This might resolve any corrupted installation files.
5. **Antivirus/Firewall Interference:** Temporarily disable your antivirus software and firewall to see if they're interfering with the Expo CLI.  Re-enable them after testing.
6. **Permissions Issues:** If using a non-administrative account, try running the Expo CLI as an administrator. 
7. **Alternative Shell:** If possible, try using a different shell (e.g., switching from PowerShell to cmd.exe or vice versa) to execute the `expo start` command.
8. **Clean Node Modules:**  Delete the `node_modules` folder in your project and reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. This can often resolve problems with dependency conflicts.
9. **Check for conflicting Node.js versions:**  Ensure that only one version of Node.js is active on your system, particularly on systems with Node Version Managers (NVMs).

If none of these steps work, provide the following information for more tailored assistance:

* Operating System (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* Node.js version
* npm/yarn version
* Expo CLI version
* Your shell
* Relevant parts of your PATH environment variable
* The output of `expo --version`
