While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the development process.  I was attempting to run expo start on a project, but it failed with the following message: `Error: spawn cmd ENOENT`. This error suggests that the command interpreter (cmd.exe on Windows or bash/zsh on macOS/Linux) could not be found or is not accessible.  I have checked my system's PATH environment variable, and it appears to be correctly configured. Despite this, the Expo CLI still cannot find the command interpreter.  I've also verified that the Node.js and npm/yarn installations are functional, and other CLI tools are working as expected.  This issue occurs regardless of whether I run the command as administrator or from different directories.
