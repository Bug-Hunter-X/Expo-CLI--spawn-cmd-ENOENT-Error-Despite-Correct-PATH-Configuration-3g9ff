# Expo CLI: spawn cmd ENOENT Error

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using the Expo CLI. The error `Error: spawn cmd ENOENT` occurs even when the system's PATH environment variable is correctly configured.

The `bug.js` file contains a minimal reproduction of the issue (which may not be needed for this specific bug, but useful for demonstrating other Expo CLI bugs.).  The `bugSolution.js` file contains a potential solution if found, or if a similar bug would need a fix, suggestions would be added to improve the CLI error handling. 

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the `Error: spawn cmd ENOENT` error.

## Potential Solutions and Workarounds

While the PATH appears correct,  investigating the following might resolve the issue:

* **Restart your system:** A simple restart can sometimes resolve unexpected path issues.
* **Check for conflicting installations of Node.js or npm/yarn:** Multiple versions could cause conflicts.
* **Reinstall Expo CLI:**  `npm uninstall -g expo-cli && npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global remove expo-cli && yarn global add expo-cli`
* **Verify that your shell is correctly configured to use the PATH variable**
* **Check for any antivirus or firewall interference:** These might be blocking the CLI's access to the command interpreter.
* **Try different shells:** If you're on a system supporting multiple shells, try running the Expo CLI with a different one.
